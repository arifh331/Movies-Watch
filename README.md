## Project Overview

This project is a web page that focuses on creating a responsive and fashionable design for a watchlist. While there are many websites that allow users to search for movies and save them to a watchlist, they often lack simplicity. The goal of this project was to address this issue and provide a user-friendly watchlist experience.

The OMDb API was utilized to fetch movie data and display it on the web page. By leveraging this API, the project was able to access comprehensive movie information to enhance the user experience. Additionally, local storage was implemented to save the movies that the user has added to their watchlist. This enables users to conveniently return to their watchlist at a later time. Notably, the watchlist feature can be used freely by both registered users and guests, eliminating the need for mandatory user logins.
